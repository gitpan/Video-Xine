Uninstalled the Xine rpms and did a "make install-debug" to track down
why the open video driver call is returning undef. (Probably it can't
find the appropriate driver.) That served to start the segfault
behavior on xine_new. The segfault happens in "do_lookup_x" in the
kernel, probably in the ld library.

I hope that going back to the RPMs make the error go away, but it's an
opportunity to study why the segfault is happening. My guess is that
it's a library mismatch. Rollo fix.

Looks like doing a complete clean and rebuild solves the segfault
issue. One of those things which I thought I'd done before, but can't
actually remember doing. Or, at least, it solves the segfault in
do_lookup_x.

Then figured out that I was passing an invalid Display pointer,
because the Video::Xine typemap is different from the Tk typemap. In
the process I changed from Newz to safemalloc.

Finally, I realized I needed to pass the ScreenNumber, not the Screen,
which is a pointer.

Currently I have an X error (much nicer than a segfault) claiming that
I'm passing an invalid Pixmap or Window parameter. Well, why should
the Window be left out?
